# Snakegame

Hello, this is my first project ever other than simple things.
There are a few bugs:
  - Apple's sometimes spawn on the snake.
  - EXPANSION_RATE can't be greater than 3, it conflicts with the death and creates problems.
  
  
 IMPORTANT !!!
 
 You need to set up the files on a server, use VS code extension Live Server.
 If you just open the index file in a browser it wont work, JS modules can't be run locally so it creates a CORS policy violation and screws it up.
